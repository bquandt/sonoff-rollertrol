# sonoff-rollertrol
Simple H-bridge circuit using a Sonoff 4ch pro device to control 12V 2wire motors.   
To use (wire it up as shown) then create two scenes 
"shades up" -- turns all switches off, then turns A,B on
"shades down" -- turns all switches off, then turns C,D on
DO NOT trigger other comboinations together, some will short out (use this diagram at your own discretion).
